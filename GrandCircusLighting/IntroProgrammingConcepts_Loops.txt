What is a loop?
---------------
student participation.

	- race tracks
	- daily routine 


Something that repeats:

	Did you pick up you clothes?

break - out of loop

Apples, peaches, pears and plums

Tell me when your birthday comes,

You would then skip "peppers" (or really fast skipping) and say the months of the year (Jan, Feb, Mar etc) trying to not get out until you reached the month of your birthday.

"Blondie and Dagwood went to town, 

Blondie bought an evening gown,

Dagwood bought the paper, 

this is what it said, 

close your eyes and

count to ten, if you miss take an end! 

One, two, three, four, five,

six, seven, eight, nine, ten!"

Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack
All dressed in black, black, black
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons
All down her back, back, back
She asked her mother, mother, mother
For fifty cents, cents, cents
To see the elephant, elephant, elephant
Jump the fence, fence fence
They jumped so high, high, high 
They touched the sky, sky, sky 
And didn't come back, back, back 
Till the fourth of July, July, July
