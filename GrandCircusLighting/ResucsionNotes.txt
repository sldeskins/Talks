Examples of 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. Famous examples include "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Amor, Roma", "race car", "stack cats", "step on no pets", "taco cat", "put it up", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" and "No 'x' in Nixon".


Looping

In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:

A simple base case (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case

What is recursion


For example, the factorial function can be defined recursively by the equations 0! = 1 and, for all n > 0, n! = n(n − 1)!. 


Recursion in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (as opposed to iteration).[
 Graham, Ronald; Donald Knuth; Oren Patashnik (1990). Concrete Mathematics. Chapter 1: Recurrent Problems.



  series for e = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...)
  
  The code above specifies a list of strings to be either empty, or a structure that contains a string and a list of strings. The self-reference in the definition permits the construction of lists of any (finite) number of strings.

Another example of inductive definition is the natural numbers (or positive integers):

A natural number is either 1 or n+1, where n is a natural number.
Similarly recursive definitions are often used to model the structure of expressions and statements in programming languages. Language designers often express grammars in a syntax such as Backus-Naur form; here is such a grammar, for a simple language of arithmetic expressions with multiplication and addition:

 <expr> ::= <number>
          | (<expr> * <expr>)
          | (<expr> + <expr>)
This says that an expression is either a number, a product of two expressions, or a sum of two expressions. By recursively referring to expressions in the second and third lines, the grammar permits arbitrarily complex arithmetic expressions such as (5 * ((3 * 6) + 8)), with more than one product or sum operation in a single expression.

Factorial

Factorial is a very simple math concept to understand, and the implementation is very close to its mathematical representation. However, they might not get it at first.

Recursive Definition of the Factorial Operation



programming example
Recurrence relation for greatest common divisor, where x \% y expresses the remainder of x / y:

\gcd(x,y) = \gcd(y, x \% y) if y \neq 0
\gcd(x,0) = x
